    <title>Symphony Embedding API Examples</title>

<body>
    <p>You must initiate a WebSocket connection with the message bus.</p>
ï»¿    <button id='open'>Open WS</button>

    <p>Add a button to both the profile and IM modules. This only places the button and does not set up a handler for when the button is clicked.</p>
    <button id='add-profile-button'>Add profile/IM button</button>

    <p>To receive notifications when the UI button is executed you must register an interest on the topic. Note the <span class="code">address</span> property matches the <span class="code">data.responseAddress</span> field of the above method. After you register you can then click the button in the UI to see a log in the console printed.</p>
    <button id="register-topic">Register interest</button>

    <p>This example shows a banner announcement across the top of the UI.</p>
    <button id='announce'>Show banner</button>

    <p>You can also start a conversation with a predefined initial message. Note this API call can take a few seconds to reflect in the UI.</p>
    <button id="talk">Start conversation</button>

    <p>Kill the WebSocket connection if you no longer need to interact with Symphony.</p>
    <button id='close'>Close WS</button>
